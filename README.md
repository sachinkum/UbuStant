# UbuStant
An Ubuntu Assistant that "listens" to you.

Project Aim - Build a virtual assistant for Ubuntu.

Current Capabilities - Performs simple operations like opening an application, creating a new document, playing music, clearing logs, updating the Operating System, etc. Uses the google-text-to-speech api for understanding the commands, and the actions are taken using bash. Currently working on Python 2.7 & bash.

Features to be added -
Port to Python 3.6 (critical).
Add a visual output when the bot speaks. Preferrrably something similar to Cortana(from Halo).
